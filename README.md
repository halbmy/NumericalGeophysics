# Numerical Geophysics
This repository accompagnies material for the graduate course called

**Numerical Simulation Methods in Geophysics**

given at TU Bergakademie Freiberg in Winter term 2024/2025.
It aims at learning the methods for solving PDEs relevant in Geophysics
* Poisson equation (Heat, DC resistivity, Darcy flow)
* Diffusion equation (Heat transfer, time-domain EM)
* Helmholtz equations (Frequency-domain EM)
* Wave equation (seismics, GPR)
* Advection-diffusion equation (flow and transport)
using the main methods
* Finite Difference (FD) method: Introduction
* Finite Elements (FE) method: Focus
* Finite Volume (FV) method: only for advection
and leads to programming them by hand and with the help of [pyGIMLi](https://pygimli.org)

Lecture material has been created by Quarto with additional Jupyter Notebooks 
that will also serve as entry points for the exercises.

The current lecture or exercise can be accessed under
https://halbmy.github.io/NumericalGeophysics/currentlecture.html
It is a Reveal.js HTML where you can make notes, use a chalkboard or print to pdf
Readily rendered pdf files for all lectures are available in the WS20xx folder.

Whe whole material is about to be rearranged as a whole website under
https://halbmy.github.io/NumericalGeophysics/
Enjoy and give feed
