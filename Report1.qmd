# Report 1

**Objective:** Use Finite Elements to solve heat transfer into the Earth caused by periodic surface temperature (upper BC)

$$ T(z=0) = T_0 + \Delta T \sin \omega t $$

initial condition: $T(z)=T_0$ (ignoring the previous heat!)

## Tasks

1. Implement functions for stiffness matrix & mass matrix using FE (including BC)
1. Use a non-equidistant discretization of the Earth with increasing layer thicknesses (choose and substantiate).
1. Solve instationary heat equation with periodic boundary condition (yearly cycle) for the Earth using a constant but meaningfull thermal diffusivity.
1. Compare the solutions using explicit, implicit and mixed timestepping methods with the analytical solution.

## Questions

* Interpret the results in terms of physical behaviour. How does a change in the diffusivity affect the result?
* After which time approaches the numeric solution the analytical one?
* Make a statement about the stability and accuracy of the methods.
* Is there a difference between FD and FE discretizations? Why (not)?
* How can you evaluate the numerical accuracy if there is no analytical solution?

## Deliverables

* Format can be Jupyter Notebook and/or PDF
* Complete codes to run the results
